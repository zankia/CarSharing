# CarShare

Carshare is an automated carshare simulation software

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* Java Development Kit (JDK), version 1.8 or better

Note: any gradle command can be executed with the given `gradlew` wrapper.

### Installing

This project is built with gradle.

To compile the project, simply run

```
gradle build
```

then you can use the generated jar in the `build folder`.

Alternately here is the command to directly compile and run

```
gradle test

## Contributing

### Workflow

We would like to stick to [git-flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) as far as possible

### Coding style

* both code and documentation are written in english
* 4 **spaces** for indentation
* declaration blocks should be like `type keyword(type p, type q) {`
* statements should be like `for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {`
* variable declarations should not be aligned.
* there should be a space before and after binary operators
* all class variable should be declared directly after class declaration
* 2 line returns only between method declaration
